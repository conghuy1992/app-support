  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> September 16, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled by the mobile application <strong>Tents &amp; Trees Puzzle</strong> ("the App"). We respect your privacy and aim to keep data practices simple and transparent.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>Local-only data:</strong> Tents &amp; Trees Puzzle stores game progress, puzzle records, and best-time scores locally on your device. Data may include board size, difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert), and completion status.</p>
  <p><strong>No personal account required:</strong> The App does not require registration or user accounts and does not collect personal information such as name, email, contacts, photos, microphone input, or GPS location for normal gameplay.</p>

  <h2>2. Analytics and Advertising</h2>
  <p>We may use third-party analytics or advertising services (e.g., Google AdMob) to understand usage patterns and serve ads. These third parties may collect non-personal information such as device type, operating system version, anonymous identifiers, and in-app usage events. Their data practices are governed by their own privacy policies.</p>
  <p>To opt out of personalized ads, please use your device settings or the ad network’s preferences.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>All gameplay data is stored locally on your device by default. We do not transmit personally identifiable information to our servers during normal use. If optional cloud backup features are introduced, you will be informed and asked for consent before any data is uploaded.</p>
  <p>We take reasonable measures to protect stored data, but no method of electronic storage is completely secure and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Tents &amp; Trees Puzzle is intended for a general audience and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal data, please contact us to have it removed.</p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
  <p>The App may include links or integrations with third-party services such as ad networks, analytics providers, or support pages. Their policies govern the handling of any information collected through those services.</p>

  <h2>6. Legal Compliance and Changes</h2>
  <p>We may disclose information if required by law or to respond to valid legal requests. This Privacy Policy may be updated occasionally; material changes will be posted here with a new effective date.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or data handled by the App, please contact us at:</p>
