  <h1>üß≠ Magnetic Field Nova - Support Page</h1>

  <p><strong>Magnetic Field Nova</strong> transforms your smartphone into a precise magnetic field detector. Using the built-in magnetometer sensor, the app measures magnetic field strength in real time and displays results in microtesla (¬µT).</p>

  <p>Whether you want to detect magnetic interference, explore science experiments, or simply test your environment, Magnetic Field Nova provides reliable and accurate readings. The app offers both <strong>live measurement</strong> and the ability to <strong>log snapshots</strong> or <strong>record sessions</strong> for later review.</p>

  <p>Featuring a simple and modern interface, readings update smoothly with clear visual indicators. Logged history is saved locally, allowing you to revisit your measurements anytime without needing an internet connection.</p>

  <p>Magnetic Field Nova is lightweight, efficient, and privacy-friendly‚Äîno data is uploaded or shared. Everything runs securely on your device.</p>

  <p><strong>Start measuring magnetic fields today!</strong> Download Magnetic Field Nova and explore your surroundings like never before.</p>

  <h2>üìÑ FAQ</h2>
  <p><strong>Q: Why does the app need sensor permission?</strong><br>
     A: Magnetic Field Nova uses the built-in magnetometer sensor. No other permissions are required, and no personal data is collected.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: What units are measurements displayed in?</strong><br>
     A: The app shows results in microtesla (¬µT), the standard unit for magnetic field strength.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: What is the difference between a snapshot and a session record?</strong><br>
     A: A snapshot saves a single measurement point with timestamp and optional note. A session record saves a continuous stream of measurements for later review.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: Does Magnetic Field Nova work offline?</strong><br>
     A: Yes! All measurements and history storage work entirely offline.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: Can I export my measurement history?</strong><br>
     A: Currently, data is stored locally for review within the app. Future updates may add export options.</p>
