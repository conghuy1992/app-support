  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> August 16, 2025</p>

  <div class="card">
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the mobile application <strong>Magnetic Field Nova</strong> (“the App”) collects, uses, and protects your information.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The App is designed to operate <strong>without collecting personal data</strong>. We do not require account creation, and we do not access your contacts, photos, calendar, or files.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Magnetometer (required):</strong> We read the device’s magnetometer to measure magnetic field strength in real time. Raw sensor values are processed on-device only.</li>
      <li><strong>Notes (optional):</strong> Any note you enter for a snapshot/session is stored locally with that entry.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Show live magnetic field values and charts.</li>
      <li>Save snapshots (single readings) or session recordings (time series) to your on-device history.</li>
      <li>Improve reading stability via on-device filtering and calibration guidance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage & Retention</h2>
    <p>All measurements, notes, and (if provided) locations are stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>. You can delete entries from History at any time or uninstall the App to remove all locally stored data.</p>

    <h2>4. Analytics & Advertising</h2>
    <p>The App currently does <strong>not</strong> send your personal data to our servers. If we integrate privacy-friendly analytics or advertising (e.g., Google AdMob) in the future, such services may collect limited, non-personal information (e.g., device type, ad interactions, anonymous identifiers) to operate and improve their features. We will update this Policy and provide in-app notice if material changes occur.</p>

    <h2>5. Sensor & Permission Details</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Magnetometer:</strong> Used solely to read magnetic field values. No raw data is transmitted off-device.</li>
      <li><strong>Location (optional):</strong> Used only when you choose to tag a log with your position. You can deny permission and continue using the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Calibration</h2>
    <p>The App may guide you to rotate your device so the operating system can refine sensor calibration. This process occurs on-device and does not transmit data to us.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We use the operating system’s security features and store data locally. While no method is 100% secure, we apply reasonable measures to protect your data on-device.</p>

    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is intended for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal information, please contact us so we can address it.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted here with an updated “Last updated” date. Material changes may also be communicated in-app.</p>

    <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or requests regarding this Privacy Policy, contact us at:</p>
