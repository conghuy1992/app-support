  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 26, 2026</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how the mobile application
    <strong>Train Tracks: Railway Puzzle</strong> ("the App")
    handles user information.
    We respect your privacy and are committed to keeping data usage minimal,
    transparent, and secure.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Local data only:</strong>
    Train Tracks: Railway Puzzle stores game-related data
    such as puzzle progress, completed levels, hints usage,
    gameplay statistics, and user preferences
    <em>locally on your device</em>.
    This allows the App to be fully playable offline.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>No personal information:</strong>
    The App does not request or collect personal data
    such as names, email addresses, phone numbers,
    contacts, photos, or precise location information.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Analytics and Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    Train Tracks: Railway Puzzle may use third-party analytics
    or advertising services (for example, Google AdMob)
    to improve gameplay experience and support the App
    through advertisements.
  </p>

  <p>
    These third-party services may collect non-personal information,
    such as device type, operating system version,
    general usage statistics, and anonymous advertising identifiers.
    We do not directly access, store, or control data
    collected by these providers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Users can manage or opt out of personalized advertising
    through their device’s system settings.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>
    All game progress and settings are stored locally on your device.
    The App does not transmit personal or gameplay data
    to external servers.
  </p>

  <p>
    If future updates introduce online features
    such as cloud saves, leaderboards, or online challenges,
    users will be clearly informed,
    and consent will be requested where required by law.
  </p>

  <p>
    While reasonable measures are taken to protect stored data,
    no digital system can guarantee absolute security.
    Use of the App is at your own discretion.
  </p>

    it will be removed promptly.

    such as advertising networks or analytics tools.
