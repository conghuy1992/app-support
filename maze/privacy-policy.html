  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 9, 2025</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how the mobile application
    <strong>Maze Solver: One Path</strong> ("the App") handles user information.
    We value your privacy and are committed to minimizing data collection,
    ensuring transparency, and protecting user data.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Local data only:</strong> Maze Solver: One Path stores game-related data
    such as level progress, completed puzzles, difficulty selection,
    player icon themes, and gameplay recordings
    <em>locally on your device</em>.
    This allows the App to function fully offline.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>No personal information:</strong> The App does not require you
    to provide personal data such as your name, email address,
    phone number, contacts, photos, or precise location.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Analytics and Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    Maze Solver: One Path may use third-party analytics or advertising services
    (for example, Google AdMob) to improve gameplay experience
    and support the App through advertisements.
    These services may collect non-personal information,
    such as device type, operating system version,
    or anonymous advertising identifiers.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not directly access, store, or control data collected
    by third-party providers.
    You may manage or opt out of personalized advertising
    through your device’s system settings.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>
    All gameplay data and preferences are stored locally on your device.
    The App does not transmit personal or gameplay data to any server.
    If future versions introduce online features such as cloud saves
    or leaderboards, your explicit consent will be requested in advance.
  </p>
  <p>
    While reasonable measures are taken to protect data,
    no digital system can guarantee absolute security.
    Use of the App is at your own discretion.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Maze Solver: One Path is suitable for users of all ages.
    The App does not knowingly collect personal information
    from children under the age of 13.
    If such data is discovered, it will be removed promptly.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The App may include third-party services such as advertising networks,
    analytics tools, or external links.
    This Privacy Policy applies only to Maze Solver: One Path
    and does not cover third-party services.
    We encourage users to review their respective privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Policy Updates and Legal Compliance</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically.
    Any changes will be reflected on this page
    with a revised “Last updated” date.
    Information may be disclosed if required by law
    or legal authorities.
