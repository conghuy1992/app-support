  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 20, 2026</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the mobile application <strong>Skyscraper Logic</strong> ("the App") handles and protects user information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and providing transparency about how data is used.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>Local data only:</strong> Skyscraper Logic stores puzzle progress, difficulty settings, theme preferences, gameplay recordings, and statistics locally on your device. This enables offline play and allows you to resume your games anytime.</p>
  <p><strong>No personal data collection:</strong> The App does not collect personal information such as your name, email address, contacts, photos, or location during normal gameplay.</p>

  <h2>2. Analytics and Advertising</h2>
  <p>The App may use third-party services such as advertising networks or analytics providers to improve the experience and support free gameplay. These services may collect non-personal information including device type, operating system version, general interaction data, and advertising identifiers.</p>
  <p>This information is used only for analytics and advertisement purposes and is not personally identifiable to us. You can manage advertising preferences through your device privacy settings.</p>

  <h2>3. Offline Gameplay</h2>
  <p>Skyscraper Logic is fully playable offline. Puzzle generation, progress tracking, and statistics do not require an internet connection.</p>
  <p>The App does not upload puzzle solutions, recordings, or gameplay history to external servers.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>All gameplay data and settings remain stored locally on your device. We do not operate user accounts or cloud storage features at this time.</p>
  <p>If future updates introduce optional online features such as cloud save or leaderboards, we will request your consent before transmitting any information.</p>
  <p>While reasonable measures are taken to protect information, no method of electronic storage is completely secure.</p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Skyscraper Logic is designed for players of all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If such information is discovered, it will be removed promptly.</p>

  <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App may integrate third-party SDKs for advertising or analytics. This Privacy Policy applies only to Skyscraper Logic. Please review the privacy policies of those providers for details about how they manage data.</p>

  <h2>7. Policy Updates</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with a revised “Last updated” date. Significant changes may also be communicated within the App.</p>

  <h2>8. Contact</h2>
