  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 23, 2026</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how the mobile application
    <strong>Hashi – Bridges Puzzle</strong> ("the App") handles user information.
    We value your privacy and are committed to keeping data collection minimal,
    transparent, and secure.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Local gameplay data only:</strong> Hashi – Bridges Puzzle stores
    game-related information such as puzzle progress,
    selected difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard),
    gameplay statistics, and preferences
    <em>locally on your device</em>.
    This enables full offline functionality.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>No personal information required:</strong>
    The App does not request or collect personal data such as your name,
    email address, phone number, contacts, photos, or precise location.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Analytics and Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    Hashi – Bridges Puzzle may use third-party analytics or advertising
    services (for example, Google AdMob) to improve the user experience
    and support the App through advertisements.
    These services may collect non-personal information such as
    device type, operating system version,
    and anonymous advertising identifiers.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not directly access, store, or control data collected
    by third-party providers.
    You may manage or opt out of personalized advertising
    through your device settings.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>
    All puzzle progress, statistics, and preferences are stored locally
    on your device. The App does not transmit personal or gameplay data
    to external servers.
  </p>
  <p>
    If future updates introduce optional features such as
    cloud backup, online leaderboards, or user accounts,
    your explicit consent will be requested before any data collection.
  </p>
  <p>
    While reasonable safeguards are implemented,
    no digital system can guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Hashi – Bridges Puzzle is suitable for users of all ages.
    The App does not knowingly collect personal information
    from children under the age of 13.
    If such data is discovered, it will be removed promptly.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The App may include third-party services such as advertising networks
    or analytics tools.
    This Privacy Policy applies only to Hashi – Bridges Puzzle
    and does not govern third-party services.
    Users are encouraged to review the privacy policies
    of those providers.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Policy Updates</h2>

    This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically.
    Any changes will be posted on this page
