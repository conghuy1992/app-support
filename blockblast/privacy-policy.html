  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 9, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the mobile application <strong>ColorBlock: Blasting</strong> ("the App") manages user information. We respect your privacy and design our game to keep your data private, secure, and transparent.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>Local data only:</strong> ColorBlock: Blasting saves your game progress, current level, score, and settings (such as light or dark theme) <em>locally on your device</em>. This ensures that you can continue your gameplay and track achievements offline.</p>
  <p><strong>No personal data collection:</strong> The App does not ask for or collect any personal information such as your name, email address, contacts, photos, or precise location for normal gameplay.</p>

  <h2>2. Analytics and Advertising</h2>
  <p>We may use third-party analytics and advertising services (for example, Google AdMob) to improve user experience and deliver relevant ads. These partners may collect non-personal data such as device type, OS version, or anonymous identifiers for analytics and ad personalization. We do not directly access or control this data.</p>
  <p>You may manage or opt out of personalized advertising in your device settings or through ad provider preferences.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>All gameplay progress and settings are stored locally on your device. No personal or gameplay data is transmitted to our servers. If future versions introduce features like cloud save or online leaderboards, we will ask for your consent before any data transfer occurs.</p>
  <p>Although we take reasonable steps to ensure your data remains secure, no system can guarantee absolute protection. Use of the App is at your own discretion.</p>

  <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>ColorBlock: Blasting is suitable for users of all ages and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If we become aware of such data, we will promptly delete it upon request.</p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App may include links or integrations with third-party services (such as ad networks, analytics tools, or support links). This Privacy Policy applies only to ColorBlock: Blasting and not to third-party websites or services. Please review their privacy policies for further details.</p>

  <h2>6. Policy Updates and Legal Compliance</h2>
  <p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted here with a new “Last updated” date. We may disclose limited information if required by law or government request.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or feedback about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
