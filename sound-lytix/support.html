  <h2>üìÑ FAQ</h2>
  <p><strong>Q: Why does the app need microphone permission?</strong><br>

     A: No. All audio is processed locally on your device. Nothing is saved or transmitted.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: Can I change the appearance of the meter?</strong><br>
     A: Yes! You can switch between different visualization themes in the settings screen. Your selected theme will be saved and used automatically next time.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: What are the new sound and vibration alerts?</strong><br>
     A: You can enable alerts that trigger a sound or vibration when noise exceeds a chosen level. This is useful in scenarios like quiet zones or noisy environments.</p>
