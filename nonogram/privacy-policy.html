  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> September 12, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled by the mobile application <strong>Nonogram Nova</strong> ("the App"). We respect your privacy and strive to keep any information handling simple and transparent.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>Local-only data:</strong> Nonogram Nova stores game progress and completed puzzle records locally on your device so you can resume and keep a log of solved puzzles. This includes information such as board size, difficulty level (Intermediate, Hard, Advanced, Expert), and whether a puzzle is completed.</p>
  <p><strong>No personal account required:</strong> The App does not require registration or user accounts and does not collect personal information (such as name, email, contacts, photos, microphone, or GPS location) for normal gameplay.</p>

  <h2>2. Analytics and Advertising</h2>
  <p>We may use third-party analytics and advertising services (for example, AdMob or similar providers) to help us understand how the App is used and to display ads. These third parties may collect non-personal information such as device type, operating system version, anonymous identifiers, and usage events. We do not control the data collection practices of these third parties; please refer to their privacy policies for details.</p>
  <p>If you would like to opt out of personalized ads, please use your device settings or the advertising settings provided by the ad network.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>All gameplay data (saved games and solved puzzles) is stored locally on your device by default. We do not transmit personally identifiable information to our servers for normal use. If you enable any optional cloud backup features (if/when available), you will be informed and asked for consent before data is uploaded.</p>
  <p>We take reasonable steps to protect data stored by the App; however, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <h2>4. Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Nonogram Nova is intended for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have accidentally collected personal data from a child, please contact us and we will promptly take steps to delete that information.</p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
  <p>The App may include links or integrations to third-party services (for example, ad networks, analytics providers, or support links). This Privacy Policy does not apply to those third parties; their services are governed by their own privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>6. Legal Compliance and Changes</h2>
  <p>We may disclose information when required by law or to respond to lawful requests by public authorities. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time; any material changes will be posted here with an updated date.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions, concerns, or requests about this Privacy Policy or data in the App, please contact us at:</p>
  <p><strong>Email:</strong> huynhconghuy92@icloud.com</p>
