    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> September 12, 2025</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled by the mobile
      application <strong>Nonogram: Logic Picture Game</strong> ("the App"). We
      respect your privacy and strive to keep any information handling simple
      and transparent.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Local-only data:</strong> Nonogram: Logic Picture Game stores game
      progress and completed puzzle records locally on your device so you can
      resume and keep a log of solved puzzles. This includes information such as
      board size, difficulty level (Intermediate, Hard, Advanced, Expert), and
      whether a puzzle is completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>No personal account required:</strong> The App does not require
      registration or user accounts and does not collect personal information
      (such as name, email, contacts, photos, microphone, or GPS location) for
      normal gameplay.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Analytics and Advertising</h2>
    <p>
      We may use third-party analytics and advertising services (for example,
      AdMob or similar providers) to help us understand how the App is used and
      to display ads. These third parties may collect non-personal information
      such as device type, operating system version, anonymous identifiers, and
      usage events. We do not control the data collection practices of these
      third parties; please refer to their privacy policies for details.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you would like to opt out of personalized ads, please use your device
      settings or the advertising settings provided by the ad network.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
      All gameplay data (saved games and solved puzzles) is stored locally on
      your device by default. We do not transmit personally identifiable
      information to our servers for normal use. If you enable any optional
      cloud backup features (if/when available), you will be informed and asked
      for consent before data is uploaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      We take reasonable steps to protect data stored by the App; however, no
      method of transmission or storage is completely secure. We cannot
      guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Nonogram: Logic Picture Game is intended for a general audience. We do not
      knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you
      believe we have accidentally collected personal data from a child, please
      contact us and we will promptly take steps to delete that information.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
    <p>
      The App may include links or integrations to third-party services (for
      example, ad networks, analytics providers, or support links). This Privacy
      Policy does not apply to those third parties; their services are governed
      by their own privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Legal Compliance and Changes</h2>
    <p>
      We may disclose information when required by law or to respond to lawful
      requests by public authorities. This Privacy Policy may be updated from
      time to time; any material changes will be posted here with an updated
      date.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Contact</h2>

      data in the App, please contact us at:
