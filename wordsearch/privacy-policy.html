  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 19, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the mobile application <strong>Word Search: Infinity Puzzle</strong> ("the App") handles and protects user information. We value your privacy and are committed to transparency in how data is stored and used.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>Local data only:</strong> Word Search: Infinity Puzzle stores your gameplay progress, puzzle history, and sound or theme settings <em>locally on your device</em>. This allows you to resume your game anytime and enjoy offline play.</p>
  <p><strong>No personal data collection:</strong> The App does not collect or store any personal information such as your name, email, contacts, or photos during regular gameplay.</p>

  <h2>2. Analytics and Advertising</h2>
  <p>The App may use third-party analytics or advertising services (such as Google AdMob) to improve the gaming experience and deliver relevant ads. These partners may collect non-personal data such as device model, operating system version, or general app activity. This information is not personally identifiable and not accessible to us directly.</p>
  <p>You can control or disable personalized ads through your device settings or the advertising provider’s privacy options.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>All game progress and preferences are stored <em>only on your device</em>. The App does not send or upload gameplay data to external servers. If future versions introduce online features (e.g., cloud saving or leaderboards), we will first request your explicit consent before sharing any data.</p>
  <p>Although we take reasonable measures to protect your data, no system is entirely secure. You use the App at your own discretion.</p>

  <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Word Search: Infinity Puzzle is suitable for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13. If we become aware of any such data, it will be deleted promptly upon notice.</p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>This App may integrate third-party SDKs for ads or analytics. This Privacy Policy applies only to Word Search: Infinity Puzzle and not to external services. Please refer to the privacy policies of these third-party providers for more details on their data handling practices.</p>

  <h2>6. Policy Updates</h2>
  <p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any updates will be posted here with a new “Last updated” date. Major changes will be communicated through the App if necessary.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
