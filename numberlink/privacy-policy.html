  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 4, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the mobile application <strong>Numberlink: ConnectFlow</strong> ("the App") handles user information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and keeping our practices simple, transparent, and secure.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>Local data only:</strong> Numberlink: ConnectFlow stores your gameplay progress, difficulty level (Beginner, Medium, Advanced, Expert), and completed puzzles <em>only on your device</em>. This information allows you to continue playing and track your history offline.</p>
  <p><strong>No personal data collection:</strong> The App does not require user registration and does not collect your name, email, photos, contacts, microphone input, or precise location for normal gameplay.</p>

  <h2>2. Analytics and Advertising</h2>
  <p>We may integrate third-party analytics and advertising services such as Google AdMob to understand usage trends and serve ads. These providers may collect non-personal data like device model, OS version, or anonymous identifiers. We do not control or access their collected data directly; please review their respective privacy policies for details.</p>
  <p>You may manage or opt out of personalized ads in your device settings or through ad network preferences.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>All progress data is stored locally on your device. We do not transmit personal or gameplay data to our servers. If cloud saving or synchronization features are added in the future, users will be notified and asked for consent before any data transfer.</p>
  <p>While we take reasonable measures to secure data stored on your device, no digital system is completely secure. Use is at your own discretion.</p>

  <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Numberlink: ConnectFlow is suitable for all ages and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If any such information is discovered, please contact us to request deletion.</p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App may include links or integrations to third-party services (for example, ad providers, analytics tools, or support links). This Privacy Policy applies only to Numberlink: ConnectFlow, not to external sites or services. Please refer to those third parties’ privacy policies for their data practices.</p>

  <h2>6. Policy Updates and Legal Compliance</h2>
  <p>We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted here with an updated "Last updated" date. We may disclose limited information if required by law or legal process.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions, feedback, or requests about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
