  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 13, 2026</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how the mobile application
    <strong>Number Maze: Zip</strong> ("the App") handles user information.
    We respect your privacy and are committed to transparency,
    minimal data collection, and protecting user data.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Local data only:</strong> Number Maze: Zip stores all game-related data
    locally on your device. This includes puzzle progress, completed levels,
    difficulty settings (Easy, Medium, Expert), gameplay history,
    and appearance preferences such as light or dark mode.
    This allows the App to function fully offline.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>No personal information:</strong> The App does not request,
    collect, or require personal information such as your name,
    email address, phone number, contacts, photos, or precise location.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Analytics and Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    Number Maze: Zip may use third-party analytics or advertising services
    (such as Google AdMob) to improve the App experience
    and support development through advertisements.
    These services may collect non-personal information,
    including device type, operating system version,
    or anonymous advertising identifiers.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not directly access, store, or control data collected
    by third-party providers.
    You can manage or opt out of personalized advertising
    through your device’s system settings.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>
    All gameplay data is stored locally on your device.
    The App does not transmit personal or gameplay data
    to any external server.
    If future versions introduce online features such as cloud saves
    or leaderboards, your explicit consent will be requested in advance.
  </p>
  <p>
    While reasonable measures are taken to protect data,
    no digital system can guarantee absolute security.
    Use of the App is at your own discretion.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Number Maze: Zip is suitable for users of all ages.
    The App does not knowingly collect personal information
    from children under the age of 13.
    If such data is discovered, it will be removed promptly.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The App may include third-party services such as advertising networks,
    analytics tools, or external links.
    This Privacy Policy applies only to Number Maze: Zip
    and does not cover third-party services.
    We encourage users to review their respective privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Policy Updates and Legal Compliance</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically.
    Any changes will be reflected on this page
    with a revised “Last updated” date.
    Information may be disclosed if required by law
    or legal authorities.
  </p>
