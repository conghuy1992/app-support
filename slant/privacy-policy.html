  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 9, 2025</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how the mobile application
    <strong>Slant – Gokigen Puzzle</strong> ("the App") handles user information.
    We respect your privacy and are committed to keeping data collection minimal,
    transparent, and secure.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Local data only:</strong> Slant – Gokigen Puzzle stores game-related data
    such as puzzle progress, completed levels, difficulty settings,
    and display preferences <em>locally on your device</em>.
    This allows the game to function fully offline.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>No personal data collection:</strong> The App does not require you
    to provide personal information such as your name, email address,
    phone number, contacts, photos, or precise location.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Analytics and Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    Slant – Gokigen Puzzle may use third-party analytics or advertising services
    (such as Google AdMob) to improve the gameplay experience
    and support the App through advertisements.
    These services may collect non-personal information,
    including device type, operating system version,
    or anonymous advertising identifiers.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not directly access, store, or control the data collected
    by these third-party providers.
    You can manage or opt out of personalized advertising
    through your device’s system settings.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>
    All gameplay data and preferences are stored locally on your device.
    The App does not transmit personal or gameplay data to our servers.
    If future versions introduce features such as cloud saves,
    online leaderboards, or accounts,
    your explicit consent will be requested beforehand.
  </p>
  <p>
    While reasonable measures are taken to protect data,
    no digital system can guarantee absolute security.
    Use of the App is at your own discretion.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Slant – Gokigen Puzzle is suitable for users of all ages.
    The App does not knowingly collect personal information
    from children under the age of 13.
    If such information is identified, it will be removed promptly.

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The App may include third-party services such as advertising networks,
    analytics tools, or external links.
    This Privacy Policy applies only to Slant – Gokigen Puzzle
    and does not cover third-party services.
    We encourage users to review their respective privacy policies.
