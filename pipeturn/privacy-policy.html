  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 24, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the mobile application <strong>Pipe Turn: Network Puzzle</strong> ("the App") handles and protects user information. We respect your privacy and are committed to being transparent about how data is stored and used.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>Local data only:</strong> Pipe Turn: Network Puzzle stores your gameplay progress, completed levels, and settings (sound, difficulty) <em>locally on your device</em>. This ensures you can resume your game anytime and enjoy offline play.</p>
  <p><strong>No personal data collection:</strong> The App does not collect or store personal information such as your name, email, contacts, or photos during gameplay.</p>

  <h2>2. Analytics and Advertising</h2>
  <p>The App may use third-party analytics or advertising services (e.g., Google AdMob) to improve gameplay and deliver relevant ads. These services may collect non-personal data such as device type, OS version, or general app activity. This information is anonymized and not personally identifiable.</p>
  <p>You can control or disable personalized ads through your device settings or the advertising provider’s privacy options.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>All game progress and preferences are stored <em>only on your device</em>. The App does not upload gameplay data to external servers. If future versions include online features (e.g., cloud saving or leaderboards), we will request your explicit consent before sharing any data.</p>
  <p>While we take reasonable measures to protect your data, no system is completely secure. You use the App at your own discretion.</p>

  <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Pipe Turn: Network Puzzle is suitable for all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If any such data is discovered, it will be deleted promptly upon notice.</p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App may integrate third-party SDKs for ads or analytics. This Privacy Policy applies only to Pipe Turn: Network Puzzle and not to external services. Please review the privacy policies of these third-party providers for details.</p>

  <h2>6. Policy Updates</h2>
  <p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any updates will be posted here with a new “Last updated” date. Major changes will be communicated through the App if necessary.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
