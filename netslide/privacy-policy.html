  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 7, 2026</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the mobile application <strong>Net Slide - Netwalk</strong> ("the App") handles and protects user information. We respect your privacy and are committed to being transparent about how data is used.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>Local data only:</strong> Net Slide - Netwalk stores your puzzle progress, difficulty selection, play history, and interface preferences (such as light or dark mode) <em>locally on your device</em>. This allows offline play and lets you continue anytime.</p>
  <p><strong>No personal data collection:</strong> The App does not collect personal information such as your name, email address, contacts, or photos during normal gameplay.</p>

  <h2>2. Analytics and Advertising</h2>
  <p>The App may use third-party services (for example, Google AdMob or analytics providers) to help improve the experience and display advertisements. These services may collect non-personal information such as device type, operating system, general interaction data, or advertising identifiers.</p>
  <p>This data is not personally identifiable to us. You can manage ad personalization through your device privacy settings.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>All gameplay data and settings remain stored on your device. The App does not upload your puzzle solutions or history to external servers.</p>
  <p>If future updates introduce online features such as cloud save, leaderboards, or accounts, we will request your permission before any information is transmitted.</p>
  <p>While we take reasonable steps to protect information, no method of storage is completely secure. Use of the App is at your own discretion.</p>

  <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Net Slide - Netwalk is designed for players of all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If such information is discovered, it will be removed promptly.</p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App may include third-party SDKs for advertising or analytics. This Privacy Policy applies only to Net Slide - Netwalk. Please review the privacy policies of those providers for details about how they manage data.</p>

  <h2>6. Policy Updates</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with a revised “Last updated” date. Significant updates may also be communicated inside the App.</p>
