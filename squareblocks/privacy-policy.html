  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 13, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the mobile application <strong>HexaBlocks - Shape Match</strong> ("the App") handles user data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency in how information is used and stored.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>Local data only:</strong> HexaBlocks - Shape Match stores your gameplay progress, mode preferences, and theme settings (light or dark) <em>locally on your device</em>. This allows you to continue playing offline and track your puzzle completions.</p>
  <p><strong>No personal data collection:</strong> The App does not request, collect, or store any personal information such as your name, email, photos, or contacts during normal use.</p>

  <h2>2. Analytics and Advertising</h2>
  <p>The App may use trusted third-party analytics or advertising services (such as Google AdMob) to improve gameplay experience and display relevant ads. These services may collect non-identifiable data such as device model, OS version, and usage patterns. We do not directly access or control this information.</p>
  <p>Users can manage or opt out of personalized advertising through their device settings or the ad provider’s preference tools.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>All saved data (including records of completed puzzles or unlocked modes) remains stored locally on your device. The App does not transmit or upload gameplay data to any external servers. If future updates add features like cloud save or leaderboards, you will be asked for explicit consent before any data is shared.</p>
  <p>While we take steps to maintain security, no system can be guaranteed 100% safe. Use of the App is at your discretion.</p>

  <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>HexaBlocks - Shape Match is designed for players of all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If such information is discovered, it will be promptly removed upon notice or request.</p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App may include links or integrations with third-party services (e.g., ads or analytics). This Privacy Policy applies only to HexaBlocks - Shape Match and not to any external websites or tools. Please refer to their own privacy policies for further details.</p>

  <h2>6. Policy Updates</h2>
  <p>We may revise this Privacy Policy occasionally. Updates will be published here with a new “Last updated” date. Any major changes will be communicated within the App if necessary.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
