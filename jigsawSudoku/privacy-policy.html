  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> September 24, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled by the mobile application <strong>Jigsaw Sudoku Puzzle</strong> ("the App"). We respect your privacy and aim to keep all practices simple and transparent.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>Local-only data:</strong> Jigsaw Sudoku Puzzle stores your game progress, selected difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert, Shuffle), and completed board records <em>only on your device</em>. This allows you to resume games or view your history later.</p>
  <p><strong>No personal account required:</strong> The App does not require registration and does not collect personal information such as your name, email, contacts, photos, microphone, or GPS location for normal gameplay.</p>

  <h2>2. Analytics and Advertising</h2>
  <p>We may use third-party analytics and advertising services (for example, Google AdMob or similar providers) to understand how the App is used and to display ads. These third parties may collect non-personal information such as device type, operating system version, anonymous identifiers, and usage events. We do not control their data practices; please review their own privacy policies for more details.</p>
  <p>You can opt out of personalized ads through your device settings or the advertising settings provided by the ad network.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>All gameplay data is stored locally on your device. We do not transmit personally identifiable information to our servers for normal use. If optional cloud backup or sync features become available in the future, you will be informed and asked for consent before any data is uploaded.</p>
  <p>We take reasonable steps to protect stored data; however, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure and we cannot guarantee absolute protection.</p>

  <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Jigsaw Sudoku Puzzle is intended for a general audience and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such data, please contact us so we can promptly delete it.</p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
  <p>The App may contain links or integrations to third-party services (such as ad networks, analytics providers, or support links). This Privacy Policy does not apply to those third parties; their services are governed by their own privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>6. Legal Compliance and Changes</h2>
  <p>We may disclose information when required by law or to respond to lawful requests by public authorities. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time; any material changes will be posted here with a new “Last updated” date.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions, concerns, or requests about this Privacy Policy or data in the App, please contact us at:</p>
