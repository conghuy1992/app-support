  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 27, 2026</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how the mobile application
    <strong>ColorLink: Color Connect</strong> ("the App")
    handles user information.
    We value your privacy and aim to keep data usage minimal,
    transparent, and secure.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Local data only:</strong>
    ColorLink: Color Connect stores game-related data
    such as puzzle progress, completed levels,
    difficulty selection, gameplay recordings,
    and user preferences
    <em>locally on your device</em>.
    This allows the App to be fully playable offline.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>No personal information:</strong>
    The App does not request or collect personal data
    such as names, email addresses, phone numbers,
    contacts, photos, or precise location information.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Analytics and Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    ColorLink: Color Connect may use third-party analytics
    or advertising services (such as Google AdMob)
    to improve gameplay experience and support development
    through advertisements.
  </p>

  <p>
    These third-party services may collect non-personal information,
    including device type, operating system version,
    general usage statistics, and anonymous advertising identifiers.
    We do not directly access, store, or control data
    collected by these providers.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can manage or opt out of personalized advertising
    through your device’s system settings.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>
    All game progress and settings are stored locally on your device.
    The App does not upload personal or gameplay data
    to external servers.
  </p>

  <p>
    If future versions introduce online features
    such as cloud saves, leaderboards, or online challenges,
    users will be clearly informed
    and consent will be requested where required by law.
  </p>

  <p>
    While reasonable measures are taken to protect stored data,
    no digital system can guarantee absolute security.
    Use of the App is at your own discretion.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    ColorLink: Color Connect is suitable for players of all ages.
    The App does not knowingly collect personal information
    from children under the age of 13.
  </p>

  <p>
    If any personal data from a child is discovered,
    it will be removed promptly.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The App may include third-party services
    such as advertising networks or analytics tools.
    This Privacy Policy applies only to
    ColorLink: Color Connect
    and does not cover third-party services.
  </p>

  <p>
    We encourage users to review the privacy policies
    of those third-party providers independently.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Policy Updates and Legal Compliance</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.
    Any changes will be posted on this page
    with an updated revision date.
  </p>

  <p>
    Information may be disclosed if required
    by applicable laws or legal authorities.
  </p>
