    <p>
      <strong>Number Slide: Move & Match</strong> is a classic sliding tile game
      that challenges your logic, memory, and problem-solving skills. Slide
      numbered tiles around the board to arrange them in the correct order —
      it’s simple to learn but tricky to master!
    </p>

    <p>
      Choose from multiple board sizes, such as 3x3, 4x4, or 5x5, each offering
      unique challenges. Every game is randomly generated, so no two puzzles are
      the same. The app works completely offline, saving your best times and
      move counts locally.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nova Puzzle is perfect for quick mental workouts or longer strategic
      sessions. With clean visuals, smooth animations, and intuitive controls,
      it delivers a relaxing yet stimulating puzzle experience.
