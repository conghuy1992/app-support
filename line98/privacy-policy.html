      Google AdMob). These services may collect non-personal information (such
      as device type, anonymous identifiers, and ad interaction data) to
      personalize and serve ads. We do not control how these third-party
      services handle your data. Please refer to the privacy policies of these
      advertising providers for more information on their data practices.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      Since we do not collect or store personal information, your privacy is
      fully respected. Any third-party services used in the game are selected
      based on reliability and security standards. Data stored locally on your
      device is subject to your device's security measures.

      action.
