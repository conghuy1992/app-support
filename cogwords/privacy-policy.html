  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 25, 2026</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how the mobile application
    <strong>Cogs Words: Letter Gears</strong> ("the App") handles user information.
    We respect your privacy and are committed to keeping data collection minimal,
    transparent, and secure.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Local gameplay data only:</strong>
    Cogs Words: Letter Gears stores gameplay progress,
    selected difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard),
    infinite puzzle progress,
    completed level records,
    and user preferences <em>locally on your device</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This allows the App to function fully offline.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>No personal information required:</strong>
    The App does not request or collect personal data such as your name,
    email address, contacts, photos, precise location, or account credentials.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Offline Play</h2>
  <p>
    Cogs Words: Letter Gears is designed to work without an internet connection.
    Puzzle data, statistics, and records remain stored locally on your device.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Analytics and Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    The App may use third-party analytics or advertising services
    (for example, Google AdMob) to improve user experience
    and support the App through advertisements.
  </p>
  <p>
    These services may collect non-personal information such as
    device type, operating system version,
    and anonymous advertising identifiers.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not directly access, store, or control data collected
    by third-party providers.
    You may manage or opt out of personalized advertising
    through your device settings.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>
    All puzzle progress, difficulty settings,
    infinite mode statistics,
    and game completion records
    are stored locally on your device.
  </p>
  <p>
    The App does not transmit personal or gameplay data to external servers.
  </p>
  <p>
    If future updates introduce optional features such as
    cloud backup, online leaderboards, or user accounts,
    your explicit consent will be requested before any data collection.
  </p>
  <p>
    While reasonable safeguards are implemented,
    no digital system can guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Cogs Words: Letter Gears is suitable for users of all ages.
    The App does not knowingly collect personal information
    from children under the age of 13.
    If such data is discovered, it will be removed promptly.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The App may include third-party services such as advertising networks
    or analytics tools.
    This Privacy Policy applies only to Cogs Words: Letter Gears
    and does not govern third-party services.
    Users are encouraged to review the privacy policies
    of those providers.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Policy Updates</h2>

    This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically.
    Any changes will be posted on this page
