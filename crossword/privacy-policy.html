  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 27, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the mobile application <strong>Crossword Puzzle: English</strong> ("the App") manages and protects user information. We respect your privacy and are committed to keeping your data secure and transparent.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>Local data only:</strong> Crossword Puzzle: English saves your puzzle progress, user preferences (such as theme and sound), and statistics <em>locally on your device</em>. This allows you to continue playing seamlessly and enjoy the game offline.</p>
  <p><strong>No personal data collection:</strong> The App does not request, collect, or store any personal information such as your name, email address, or contacts during normal gameplay.</p>

  <h2>2. Analytics and Advertising</h2>
  <p>The App may use trusted third-party services (such as Google AdMob or Firebase Analytics) to display ads and gather anonymous usage statistics. These partners may collect non-personal information like device model, operating system version, or general interaction data. This data helps us improve gameplay experience and ad relevance.</p>
  <p>You can manage or disable personalized advertising through your device’s privacy or ad settings at any time.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>All gameplay data is stored <em>only on your local device</em>. Crossword Puzzle: English does not upload or share your progress to external servers. If future updates include online features (such as cloud saving or leaderboards), we will always request your consent before transmitting any data.</p>
  <p>We take reasonable steps to protect your information, but no system can guarantee absolute security. You use the App at your own discretion.</p>

  <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Crossword Puzzle: English is designed for users of all ages and does not knowingly collect any personal data from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that personal information has been collected from a child, we will delete it immediately upon notification.</p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App may include third-party SDKs for ads or analytics. Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to <strong>Crossword Puzzle: English</strong> and not to external services. We encourage users to review the privacy policies of those third-party providers for more information on how they handle data.</p>

  <h2>6. Policy Updates</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be reflected on this page with a new “Last updated” date. Significant changes may also be announced within the App when appropriate.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
