  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 17, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the mobile application <strong>BallSort - Tube Puzzle</strong> ("the App") manages user data. We value your privacy and are committed to being transparent about how information is handled and protected.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>Local data only:</strong> BallSort - Tube Puzzle stores your gameplay progress, current levels, and sound or theme preferences <em>locally on your device</em>. This enables you to resume play seamlessly and enjoy the game offline.</p>
  <p><strong>No personal data collection:</strong> The App does not collect or store any personally identifiable information such as your name, email, contacts, or photos during normal use.</p>

  <h2>2. Analytics and Advertising</h2>
  <p>The App may include third-party analytics or advertising tools (for example, Google AdMob) to help improve the gaming experience and deliver relevant ads. These partners may gather non-personal data such as device type, operating system version, and general app usage data. This information is not directly accessible to us.</p>
  <p>You can manage or disable personalized advertising through your device settings or the advertising provider’s privacy options.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>All progress and game records are stored <em>only on your device</em>. The App does not send or upload gameplay data to any remote servers. If future versions include online features (such as cloud saves or leaderboards), we will ask for your explicit consent before sharing any data.</p>
  <p>While we take reasonable measures to ensure your data remains secure, no system can be guaranteed completely safe. Use of the App is at your own discretion.</p>

  <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>BallSort - Tube Puzzle is suitable for all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 years old. If any such information is discovered, it will be promptly deleted upon notification.</p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>This App may use third-party services such as advertising or analytics SDKs. Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to BallSort - Tube Puzzle and not to any third-party platforms. For details on their data practices, refer to their respective privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>6. Policy Updates</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Any revisions will be posted here with an updated “Last updated” date. Significant changes will be communicated within the App if necessary.</p>
