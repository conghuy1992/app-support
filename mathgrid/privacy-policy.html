  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 9, 2025</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how the mobile application
    <strong>Math Grid</strong> ("the App") handles user information.
    We respect your privacy and are committed to keeping your data secure,
    minimal, and transparent.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Local data only:</strong> Math Grid stores game-related data such as
    puzzle progress, completed levels, difficulty settings, win records,
    and display preferences (including light or dark mode)
    <em>locally on your device</em>.
    This allows you to continue playing and track your achievements offline.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>No personal data collection:</strong> Math Grid does not require you
    to provide personal information such as your name, email address, phone number,
    contacts, photos, or precise location in order to play the game.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Analytics and Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    Math Grid may use third-party analytics or advertising services
    (such as Google AdMob) to help improve gameplay experience
    and support the app through ads.
    These services may collect non-personal information,
    such as device type, operating system version,
    or anonymous advertising identifiers.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not directly access, store, or control data collected by these
    third-party providers.
    You can manage or opt out of personalized advertising through your
    device settings or ad provider preferences.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>
    All gameplay data and preferences are stored locally on your device.
    Math Grid does not transmit personal or gameplay data to our servers.
    If future versions include features such as cloud saves,
    online leaderboards, or account systems,
    your consent will be requested before any data is collected or shared.
  </p>
  <p>
    While we take reasonable measures to protect your data,
    no digital system can guarantee absolute security.
    Use of the App is at your own discretion.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Math Grid is suitable for users of all ages and is designed
    as a logic and math puzzle game.
    The App does not knowingly collect personal information
    from children under the age of 13.
    If such information is discovered, it will be deleted promptly.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The App may include third-party services such as advertising networks,
    analytics tools, or support links.
    This Privacy Policy applies only to Math Grid
    and does not cover third-party websites or services.
    We encourage you to review their respective privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Policy Updates and Legal Compliance</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
    Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated
    “Last updated” date.
    We may disclose limited information if required to do so by law
    or governmental request.
